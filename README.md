# Heart_Disease_Prediction
## Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest Algorithm Classifier
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on a set of input features. 
This README file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for running and understanding the code.

## Project Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction project is a data-driven initiative aimed at utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease. 
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection can significantly impact patient outcomes.
This project focuses on creating an accurate predictive model that uses a set of medical attributes to assess the risk of heart disease.

## Features
~ Prediction Accuracy: Develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on input features.

~ Early Detection: Provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease at an early stage, enabling timely intervention and treatment.

~ Feature Importance: Identify the most significant factors contributing to heart disease prediction, helping medical practitioners understand the key indicators.

~ User-Friendly Interface: Create an easy-to-use interface where medical professionals or users can input patient data and receive instant predictions.

## Prerequisites
 Python(3.11),
 Jupyter Notebook,
 Advance Python,
 Machine Learning

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle.
It contains various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. 
The target variable indicates whether a person has heart disease (1) or not (0).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   git clone https://github.com/Dhruv2535/Heart_Disease_Prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   cd heart-disease-prediction

3. Install the required dependencies.

   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Model
The predictive model used in this project is a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.) trained on the provided dataset. 
The model has been trained to learn patterns and relationships between input features and the presence of heart disease.

## Results
After running the prediction script, you will see a list of predictions indicating the likelihood of heart disease for each individual in the dataset
Additionally, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be displayed to evaluate the model's performance.
